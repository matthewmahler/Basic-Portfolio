      <p id="about">
        <img id="profile" src="assets/images/thaumiel.jpg" alt="some loser" height="150" width="150"> Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard
        dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen
        book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially
        unchanged.</p>
        <p>
        It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and
        more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
